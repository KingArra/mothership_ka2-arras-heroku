ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Insert the Domination Script where you need to put it in server.js . Put the Dominator Tanks where you need. In definitions.js .
Imperium: I need to get exports.dominationbody from a template i have, wait a bit
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: OK.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Tell me when you are done.
Imperium: definitons.js is done but Trapper Dominator is unavailable.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Understood.
Imperium: and i will be making it 2-Team, not 4-Team.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: How? Sometimes it failed! Even when I tried normal Mothership!
Imperium: What do you mean?
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: When I tried 2 Team Mothership, it was 4 teams instead of 2 teams!
Imperium: we will fix that by removing other 2 teams.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: I tried doing what I did in my 2 Team game, but it didn't work.
Imperium: oh. i didnt know that.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Keep on trying. I can wait and be patient.
Imperium: did you have a fixed point of spawn for Motherships?
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: I don't know how. Maybe you can help me after this is done?
Imperium: umm... i dont know.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Why don't we just get this done then we can talk about Mothership?
Imperium: good idea. im back to work.
Imperium: my Glitch Search is glitched out, i cannot find codes, but nevermind i will still try to do what i will do.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: That's OK, we should stay focused.
Imperium: my internet was glitched out. im back now.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Good.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: The dominator with no guns is usually used in D-Day event. We can use it if you want.
Imperium: we are using it for gunner and destroyer dominator template already.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Alright, thanks for telling me your opinion.
Imperium: lets see if they spawns.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Let's do it. I'll get the link.
Imperium: it didn't worked.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: We need the room to be bigger.
Imperium: oops i did the spawn function but didn't used it. thats why they wasnt spawning. lets try again.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Agreed.
Imperium: it worked too much.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: What does that mean?
Imperium: theres Over 100 dominators in the map.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Let me see...
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: It won't let me enter the game.
Imperium: I'll send an image in the DM's.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: Good idea.
ℙ𝕣𝕠𝕂𝕒𝕞𝕖𝕣𝕠𝕟: You are right, we need to fix it.
Imperium: yes... i will try to see whats the problem now.
